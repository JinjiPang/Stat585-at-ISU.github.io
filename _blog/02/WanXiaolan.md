## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1.**Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**

I read chapter 12 RStudio to Git and GitHub. This chapter told us how to connect Rstudio to Github.  Before the connection, The author suggests us to prepare and check the followings: registering a free GitHub account, installing RStudio and Git, and introducing themselves to Git (). After this preparation, we then make a new repo on GitHub and set it as public, and copy a clone URL to clipboard. Then,  start a new Project in R studio and paste the URL of new GitHub repository. In the last step, we  accept the default project directory name, which coincides with the GitHub repo name, and pay attention to the directory. Finally, we can find it in a new local RStudio Project that represents the repository on GitHub.


2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**.
 
One of the challenges is communication among team members. In the past project, each of the team member works on different files, and it is hard to get prompt feedback from other team members. Usually, we just combine these separate files in the last minute. In Github, it is convenient for team members to work on their assigned duty and check the update of other team members because we work on the same repository and can easily share our code to team members. 

3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I learned how to clone someone elseâ€™s repository on GitHub. First, I need to pick a GitHub repository that I want to make a copy, 
and then create a new RStudio Project from this GitHub repo. After I get the code locally, I can try to run some of it. I built a book Advanced R through this chapter.
