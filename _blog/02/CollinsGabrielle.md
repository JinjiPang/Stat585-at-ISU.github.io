## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
I chose to read the first chapter of the book, since I am still relatively new to Git/GitHub. The chapter introduces many of the terms associated with Git and GitHub, such as pull, commit, push, merge and repository. It also goes through some of the pros of using Git and GitHub, specifically that it is most useful for people working in a collaborative environment. The author compares using Git and GitHub to using a google doc, and that although Git can be more compliacted, it supports a lot of the same benefits as a google doc. The article goes on to mention that you can make work publically available on GitHub, and that the target audiance is anyone who analyzes data and uses R. Ultimately, the first chapter highlights why Git/Github is useful tool when doing data analysis in any type of group setting. 

2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
I think the biggest mishap in a team project I had, was trying to get everyone on the team to tidy the data in the same format. Since we all chose to tidy the data ourselves, we were all working with slightly different versions of the same data set, and hence ran into issues when comparing our analyses. I definitely think this could have been avoided using Git, because we all would have had easy access to the same tidy dataset, and hence would've been conducting our analysis based on the same assumptions. 
3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
I learned about the fork feature in GitHub. The fork feature allows you to keep a copy of a repository, without editing the original copy. This can be especially useful if you are interested in someone else's work, and want to try a slight variation of what that person did on your own.
