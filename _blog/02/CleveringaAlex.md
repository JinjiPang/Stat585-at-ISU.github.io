## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I chose to read chapter 15, "New project, GitHub first." I chose this chapter because it appeared to be where I fall off the wagon, so to speak. I have had a GitHub account set up for a few years, went through the tutorial, and never understood how it worked beyond that. I still don't exactly know the difference between a pull and a commit. I was able to follow the instructions in the chapter with almost no trouble, except that I didn't realize the GitLab stuff was optional, and it was not immediately obvious to me that all I had to do to access the README file in RStudio was to click on the file in the "Files" window of RStudio. The tutorial was simple and powerful, and it was rewarding to push changes from RStudio and pull them in and see them appear in GitHub, and to make changes in GitHub and see them in RStudio.

For better or worse, I have not had much experience working on team projects in RStudio where we are sharing files. We usually have our own folders and files that we work on. I did have a "practice file" where I would try to do different things, and then I would copy and paste what was useful into a different shared file. By using GitHub, I could use the same shared file, and not execute a push in sessions where I am just practicing, or not pull them from GitHub. I see the new methods I learned being useful in the future, where I anticipate working on files in close conjunction with my colleagues.

Everything I read about Git from Jenny Bryan's book was new to me, which was surprisingly easy to follow along. Learning how to make changes in the README file in RStudio or GitHub and being able to see them in the other program was really fun. I look forward to doing this with other types of files and seeing the changes I make in RStudio propagate to GitHub.
