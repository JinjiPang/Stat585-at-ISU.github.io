## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
 - Chapter 12 of Happy Git and Github with R introduces the user to mediating between github and Rstudio. Thus, the Chapter teacher how to manage a github repository through the Rstudio platform. This process includes *Cloning a github repository*, *Editing in Rstudio*, *committing*, and *pushing back to update one's github repository*. In as much as it is possible to edit a file in a github repository, this is not always convenient. Working in the Rstudio Project environment comes with the added advantage of being able to work on multiple projects, each in it's own directory at the same time. This is to say that it was helpful reading this chapter. 

2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
 - During my Senior year in College, I worked with a colleague to write a thesis in order to fulfill degree requirement. As it is usually the case, we had to work independently sometimes. Our biggest challenge was merging our works. Looking back, an introduction to git and github would have saved us from a lot of trouble and made working together more efficient. 

3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

 - Through Jenny Bryan's book, I got introduced to SSH keys. I was able to set up a SSH key. This helped in my effort to clones a github repository on Rstudio. 
 - Reading some chapters of the book introduced me to some useful Data Science 
collaborative practices. For example, I find <strong> Chapter 20 (Repo, Commit, diff, tag)</strong> very helpful.
