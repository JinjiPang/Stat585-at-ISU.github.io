## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

1.) I am rather new to using Git/Github, so I wanted to get a "big picture" understanding of how Github operates, as well as the benefits of using it. I was able to gather this information in Chapter 1. The "big picture" process is that you can track, save, and share code (public or privately) to an internet based host, in a very structured and organized way. In our case, this would be using RStudio to write/edit code, and we are saving and sharing that code with others via Github (an internet source). As discussed in chapter 1, the terminology and installation/connection of Git to RStudio may be tedious and confusing, however this is a one-time process. Personally, re-reading the definitons of repository, commit, and push have assured my understanding of what is going on. A repository is a folder of files that you're editing/working on, you then "commit" changes, which saves edits to the entire project in RStudio, and you "push" or save those edits to Githhub. Some benefits of using Github are having your code easily accessible for anyone to read/edit as well as collaborative coding. 

2.) Refecting on coding projects that I've done in the past, it would have been beneficial to use Github to manage and share code with multiple people. Specifically, this would have been beneficial in the 579 final project. My group decided to split up portions of the proejct and work independently on the code. When it came time to put our code together into on cohesive file, we emailed each other. This was messy and we got confused with sending multiple drafts due to errors. We could have used Github to share our files with each other in a smoother, more efficient way that allows for easy edits. This would have kept us more organized as well since our files would be saved in one specific place instead of lost in email.

3.) One new feature that I've learned from Jenny Bryan's book is the creation of an ".md" file, aka the intermediate of an ".rmd" and ".html" file. ".md" files are much easier to view via Github. These types of files are best to create because they allow you to read your file on a webpage in an "html" way, but your code is still shown.
