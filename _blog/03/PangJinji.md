## Prompt:

The `plyr` package has by now been replaced by other, even faster packages, but the idea of *Split, apply, combine* is as relevant as ever.

Read the paper [The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) by Hadley Wickham.


Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **The R code for the split-apply-combine paper is posted with the paper. Pick one of the examples demonstrating `plyr` functionality (such as dlply or ddply, ...) and rewrite the example using functionality from the package `dplyr`. Make sure that your example actually works.**







```r
baberuth <- subset(baseball, id == "ruthba01")
baberuth <- transform(baberuth, cyear = year - min(year) + 1)

## using plyr 

baseball1 <- ddply(baseball, .(id), transform, 
  cyear = year - min(year) + 1)

head(baseball1)
```

```

2. **Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient? State why or why not?**. 

- split(), lapply(),aggregate().

- I feel these are not sufficient enough, because the complication of using *base R* functions is in attaching appropriate labels to the data. The type of labels needed depends on the output data structure. We need to use functions to match their source data in order to extract informative lables. In contrast, *plyr* takes care of adding the appropriate labels automatically. Also, *plyr* caters for every combination of input and output data types(array, data frame, list) in a consistent way, while *base R* 's has limitations in terms of input and output data formats.


3. **In 50 to 100 words describe the split-apply-combine paradigm.**

- Data are complicated when they have more than one dimensions. For example, some data involve temporal variables, some involve spatial variables and some have repeated measurements for one object. Using split-apply-combine method to analyze such complicated data will make the analysis more operable and explicit. We can first break up a big data into manageable pieces. Usually, we want to split the large data set into small groups based on combinations of variables in the data set. Then operate on each piece independently and eventually put all the pieces back together.
