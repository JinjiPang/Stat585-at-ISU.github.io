## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
This chapter clarifies that why we need to use Git and GitHub. 
Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. GitHub is where hosting services provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet. If someone needs to see your work or if you want them to try out your code, they can easily get it from GitHub. If you need to collaborate on data analysis or code development, then everyone should use Git. A public repository is readable by the world. A private repository is invisible to the world. An organization repository can be useful for managing repository permissions for entire teams of people. The target audience for this site is someone who analyzes data, probably with R, though some of the content may be useful to analysts using other languages.
3. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
Yes, the hierarchy of doing a project from the first to the end can be completely understood with Git. Also, the interaction between team people is very easy using Git.
5. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
For example, if one of my friends asks me about a special code I wrote before, I can direct him/her to GitHub to find that.
