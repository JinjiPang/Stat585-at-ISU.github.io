## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
I read chapter 15: New project, GitHub first. This chapter gives suggestions that when starting a new project, start with creating a Github respository with initializing a README file first before start working in Rstudio. Also, some habits are encouraged to develop. When working in the local Git repository, it's a good idea to make commits whenever there is new work. Besides that, you are supposed to periodically pushing local commits to GitHub to make your work accessible to others online. But before your attempt to push, keep in mind to pull changes from GitHub because your collaborators may have pushed their work and you don't want to overwrite their work. 

2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
The biggest mishap for me was to keep track of and combine changes that individual group members made. We often needed to send each other's work back and forth to compare, combine and update. Also, we usually needed to schedule a time and everyone sat down together, organized everything on one local machine, and wrapped up the work. With git, members can work in parallel, be aware of each other's work as well as all the changes made, and record all the work automatically, which is much more efficient.

3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
I learned about branching, which is a way for collaborators to try experimental ideas in parallel and avoid changes in main stream of development. For example, if I want to try some things I am not sure about, I can create a new branch and test my work in the new branch instead of the main, so that my attempt will not make conflict with others' work and if my idea works, I can merge this branch to the main afterwards.
