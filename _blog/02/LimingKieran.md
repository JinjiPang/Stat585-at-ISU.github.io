## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**

I chose to read the chapter "New project, GitHub first." This chapter was about making a repository on GitHub for projects in R. It made me realize that I might have messed up pushing my local changes from lab 1 to my group's repository on GitHub, and I will try to address that after the blog. 

This chapter walks you throught the steps of connecting your RStudio project to a repository on GitHub which is useful for a handful of reasons. Foremost, is that it make asychronous group work possible from multiple devices (like our class labs). Additionally, these ideas are specifically useful for me because I work from two computers and now I can synch up my projects without inefficiently sending files to myself. 

3. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

I hat multiple projects in undergrad that would have been greatly streamlined with better implementation of these procedures. My groups would often meet in person and work together effectively on one device to code and work through changes on a project. So in terms of mishaps, I am not sure that git would have specifically saved us in anyway, but it definitely would have made doing groups projects easier than the way we were doing it.

4. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

The biggest takeaway from this chapter is setting up projects in Rstudio from a github repository. We went over this in class last Thursday, but I did not realize the potential uses for this until reading this chapter and trying to implement it on my second device. Hopefully, I will get this successfully set up on my desktop now, too.
