## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**

    I read Chapter 26 and Chapter 27 in-depth,
    as they are somehow related to each other.
    These two chapters provided me with two "conflict" suggestions at the first glance,
    one suggesting use repeated amend,
    while the other suggests pushing more often and leaving others integrating the changes,
    which is quite interesting.
    I never used repeated amend before,
    instead,
    I kept pushing small changes I made,
    which is kind of annoying even to me,
    as I need to come up with a lot of messages when committing.
    These two suggestions actually provide a new way for me to use git and GitHub,
    small changes by amending and large changes by pushing.
    When dealing with a large group project,
    the real challenge might not be when to amend and when to push,
    but how you divide the job clearly enough to corporate together.
    

2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

    Back in my Bachelor,
    I used to work with my teammates on Google products,
    either Google Drive or Google Docs.
    It is more convenient compared to using git and GitHub,
    as we don't need to bother what version we are using since we only have one,
    and we don't need to pull and push,
    just save.
    Each time we worked together online.
    After revising our project for months,
    we had a meeting with the professor before the presentation,
    and he pointed out the method we used before should be better than what we had then.
    It must be some bugs in the program which led to the poor performance,
    but we cannot just go back to that time and start modifying it,
    as we had already overwritten it.
    If with git,
    we can figure out which commit that is,
    and start revising it instead of redoing everything.
    That would definitely make the project much easier.


3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
    
    How to create a new branch and work on it.
    I always work on the main and have never used this feature before.
